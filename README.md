# Odin Admin Dashboard
This repository contains an admin dashboard project, built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. It's a web-based interface simulating the control panel for a dummy router "AeroLink Pro", providing a user-friendly way to manage router configurations and monitor its status.

**Navigation Sidebar:**

The dashboard features a prominent sidebar on the left for easy navigation to different sections:

* **Home (overview)**
* **WAN Settings**
* **LAN Settings**
* **WiFi Settings**
* **VPN Settings**
* **Other Settings**
* **Firmware Update**
* **Reset & Restart**
* **Get Support**

**Main Dashboard Sections:**

The main content area of the dashboard is organized into key sections, accessed primarily through the sidebar navigation:

* **Settings:**  This section encompasses the most popular router configuration options, including:
    * **WiFi Settings:** Customize your wireless network name (SSID), password, security protocols, and channel.

    * **Parental Control:** Manage internet access for family members with time limits and content filtering options.
    * **IPTV:** Configure settings for your Internet Protocol Television service to enable streaming.
    * **Backup and Restore:** Save and load your router configuration for easy setup and recovery.
    * **Port Forwarding:** Direct specific internet traffic to devices on your local network for services.
